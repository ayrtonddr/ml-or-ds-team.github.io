<p><h4>Thank you for your interest in joining the team.</h4></p>

<p>We put an interview process together so to understand your expertise, experience and interest beyond your AWESOME Resume.
    We also want you to have opportunity and plenty of time to ask us questions.<br/> 
    <br/>
    Before the interview, we want to have a quick chat with you to introduce the team and understand your interest. If we have mutual interest,
    we would love to invite you to the interview process. <br>
    <br/>
    The interview process will be of THREE rounds.
    <ul>
        <li> Intro + Experience Chat: 30 minutes</li>
        <li> Case Study + Domain Knowledge: 30 minutes</li>
        <li> Coding + Design: 30-45 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    While we explicitly list time constraint for each round, we want to make sure you have enough time to chat with us, 
    solve a problem, finish your coding task, and ASK US TONS OF QUESTIONS. Therefore, we are very flexible in time constraints,
    and we want you to feel comfortable as much as possible!<br/>
    <br/>
    Just a tip, we are a fast-paced team, we take risks, and we care about business results more than anything else ... 
    we expect you can help us maintain this culture, and we belive you can!!!<br/>
</p>

<p><h4>If you are interested in joining us for the mentorship program...</h4></p>
<p> ... instead of the aforementioned interview process, 
  we would love to have you meet one of the core members from the team for 30-45 minutes. We are extremely humble 
  and we want to ensure a good quaility of mentorship as long as 
  we make the commitment to you. Therefore, we implement the chat session as an interview to understand your interest, 
  and to make sure we are the right choice for you. 
  <br>During the 30-45 minutes chat, we will want to
  <ul>
    <li> understand your interest and goal</li>
    <li> ask your questions on domain knowledge and case study</li>
    <li> (sometimes...) do a very lightweighted coding exercise in Python</li>
</ul> 
<br/>
We want to make sure you feel comfortable in the chat session, and we are very flexible in the process. 
We will communicate with you and discuss the process prior to the chat!
