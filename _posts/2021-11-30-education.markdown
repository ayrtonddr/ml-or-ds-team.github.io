Ayrton Didhier Mondragon, Andrew St. Johns and Zheng Shi are identified by IBM Expert Lab as Subject Matter Experts in the field of machine learning and data science, 
and they are invited (along with 12 other experts in IBM) to participate in creating the exam to certify machine learning specialists at the quality of an industry standard. The certification will be released 
next year and open to the general public.
